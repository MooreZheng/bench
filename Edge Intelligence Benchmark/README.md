# Edge Intelligence Benchmark
Edge computing emerges as a promising technical framework to overcome the challenges in cloud computing. In this AI era, AI applications are the most critical types of application on the edge. Edge Intelligence techniques are widely used to augment device, edge and cloud intelligence, and they are most demanding in terms of computing power, data storage, and network. 

However, Edge Intelligence is in the initial stage and does not have 1) a comprehensive evaluation standard for Edge Intelligence scenarios; 2) with an end-to-end testbed for three-layer on edge cloud. Therefore, this project is to establish a comprehensive end-to-end Edge Intelligence benchmark suite to measure and optimize the systems and applications.
